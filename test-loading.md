# Loading Animation Test

## Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented a loading animation ("...") for assistant messages while waiting for the model's response:

1. **Created LoadingDots Component** (`/src/components/ui/LoadingDots.tsx`):
   - Shows three dots with a cycling animation
   - Each dot animates with opacity changes at different delays

2. **Added CSS Animation** (`/src/app/globals.css`):
   - Added `@keyframes loading-dot` animation
   - Dots fade in and out with 0.3 to 1 opacity

3. **Updated ChatMessage Component** (`/src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`):
   - Shows LoadingDots when:
     - Message is from assistant
     - Content is empty
     - Thinking is not complete
   - Otherwise shows the actual message content

## How It Works

When `addAssistantPlaceholder` is called in `useChatActions.ts`, it creates an assistant message with:
- Empty `content`
- Empty `mainContent`
- `isThinkingComplete: false`

The ChatMessage component detects this state and shows the loading animation instead of empty content.

## Testing

To test:
1. Send a message in the chat
2. You should see "..." animation in the assistant's message box
3. Once the model starts responding, the dots are replaced with actual content
